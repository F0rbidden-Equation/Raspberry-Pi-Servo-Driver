                                            RASPBERRY PI SERVO DRIVER HAT

The servo driver HAT is a PWM based expansion board designed for Raspberry Pi. The PCA9685 chip expands up to 16 channels and supports 12-bits resolution for each channel. It uses the I2C protocol for communication purpose.

SPECIFICATIONS:
> Power supply: 5V OR 6V~12V (terminal)
> Servo voltage: 5V
> Logic voltage: 3.3V
> Driver: PCA9685
> Control interface: I2C

FEATURES:
> Up to 16-Channel servo/PWM outputs, 12-bit resolution for each channel (4096 scales).
> 3 pin connectors in groups of 4 so you can plug in 16 servos at once.
> This board/chip uses I2C 7-bit address.
