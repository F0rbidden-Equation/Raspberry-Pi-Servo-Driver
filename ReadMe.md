# RASPBERRY PI SERVO DRIVER HAT

The servo driver HAT is a PWM based expansion board designed for Raspberry Pi. The PCA9685 chip expands up to 16 channels and supports 12-bits resolution for each channel. It uses the I2C protocol for communication purpose.

## SPECIFICATIONS:
1. Power supply: 5V OR 6V~12V (terminal)
2. Servo voltage: 5V
3. Logic voltage: 3.3V
4. Driver: PCA9685
5. Control interface: I2C

## FEATURES:
1. Up to 16-Channel servo/PWM outputs, 12-bit resolution for each channel (4096 scales).
2. 3 pin connectors in groups of 4 so you can plug in 16 servos at once.
3. This board/chip uses I2C 7-bit address.
4. 40 Pin GPIO access
5. I2C controlled
6. Power supply connector
